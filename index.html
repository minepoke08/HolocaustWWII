    <td>1</td>
    <td>He was a great speaker, very influential on the people, and ruthless.</td>
    <td>He forced rapid Industrialization and merging individual peasant farms. The growth of factories caused a large amount of lives though increased production.</td>
    <td>He was a man that rose to power. He was very passionate about what he wanted and was very persuasive.</td>
    <td>Our dictator was named Hideki Tojo. He believed that Japan should have gone to war. He was regarded as divine because his family had a large amount of honour, due to a large amount of his family sacrificing themselves for Japan.</td>

    <td>2</td>
    <td>Hitler rose to power because there was moderate political parties that wouldn't work together, an economic depression, because of this people got angry and turned to extremist parties like the Nazis.</td>
    <td>The events that lead to the rise of stalin were poverty during WW1, a revolution, and the murder of the royal family.</td>
    <td>On March in 1919, he formed the fascist party and that caused him to get a lot of support from people in poverty. On October in 1922, Italy was in chaos and was one of the only people that could make it better. King Victor Emmanuel made it so that Mussolini could have the government.</td>
    <td>He was a Japanese dictator that was a general, later elected as a prime minister. Later in the war, he rose to power and was elected as prime minister. He was always hard and precise and very meticulous in his plans.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>He had always hated the multi-ethnic way Austria ruled, he also thought that his race was the strongest and the purest.</td>
    <td>When he was 7 and got smallpox that made his face scarred. He was also injured in an accident that left his arm deformed.</td>
    <td>He enjoyed oppressing people that are different like Hitler. He wanted to rise italy to power once again and didn’t care about the people who die along the way.</td>
    <td>He gave the order to attack pearl harbor. That initiated the war against the united states and got them fighting in the war. Though he was actually really racist and wanted to kill all chinese. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>The rise was economic depression and anger and the multi ethnic way of politicians.</td>
    <td>Lenin’s death in 1924 led stalin to set out to destroy the other parties of leadership and take control.</td>
    <td>Mussolini’s persuasive nature and convincing arguments he used against the current leaders led to his rise of power. His ideas were different and he got a lot of support from his target groups such as unemployed veterans. He also appeared as the only person who could fix Italy’s problems which was a huge reason that he gained support.</td>
    <td>One way Tojo rose was by gaining the rank of general, giving him control of the Japanese army. In July of 1940, he became the minister of the war. He controlled armies, became a general and minister, and supported the bombing of Pearl Harbor.</td>

<h4>Part 2</h4>
<h4>Michel</h4>
<ol>
<li>Every dictator should possess the qualities of dedication, persuasion and grit because, they need to support their country, people, and allies.</li>
<li>If Hideki Tojo’s family hadn’t sacrificed their lives for Japan, then Hideki Tojo would be dictator, because a big reason why he became a dictator was the amount of honour his family had.</li>
<li><img src="file:///Users/michel/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/.Trash/Persuasion.jpg" alt="Fat Man - Political Cartoon" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><img src="file:///Users/michel/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/.Trash/Hard%20Work.jpg" alt="Hard Work - Political Cartoon" style="width:300px;height:300px;"> </li>
<li>The first image is showing hard work or in other words grit. A good dictator needs to have the characteristics of grit because, without hard work, they won’t get anywhere. Even if they are extremely smart, they could be lazy, letting their knowledge go to waste. The second image shows persuasion. A good leader needs to be able to persuade the crowd on multiple occasions. One reason they need to persuade the people is to get them to support them. After becoming dictator, they need to be able to obtain the crowd's support when deciding on something, an example is going to war.</li>

</ol></br>
<h4>Davis</h4>
<ol>
<li>Every dictator should possess the qualities of persuasion, a lust for power, and honor to his/her people because they will help them gain support, claim countries, and convince the people to trust him/her.</li>
<li>If a country has a gap for power, a dictator will rise to take it, because they have a lust for power.</li>

<h4>Part Two</h4>
<p>Propaganda is a way to convince people of your ideals. In nazi germany propaganda was everywhere. It was in books, movies and many other things. They were very much against jewish people. Propaganda camps did not prohibit violence against jews. The Nazi propaganda was “restoring germany” by getting rid of jewish people. Jewish people were discriminated and ridiculed. The nazis would try to get other countries to agree with them. After the nazis invaded the soviet union, they tried to use propaganda on them. The newspapers would be pro nazi too.There was yellow journalism and many other things. In the so-called final solution, jewish people were mass murdered. This shows just how good the nazis were at wielding propaganda.</p>
<p>Propaganda, a very influencing tactic, is used because it influences the population, tricks people, and helps leaders/dictators gain support. Primarily, propaganda is used because it helps sway the population. By swaying the population, people will believe what a person does, giving respect and support. Furthermore, propaganda is a vital tactic because it helps trick people. By using propaganda, people fall for false information, anywhere from “TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT!” to “When you ride ALONE you ride with Hitler.” Subsequently, leaders/dictators use propaganda to influence people and gain support. One very famous dictator that used propaganda for their benefit is Hitler, a German dictator who led the Nazis to many wars, one famous war being World War II. To sum up, propaganda is a very used tactic because it helps influence the population, tricks people into believing other things, and helps leaders/dictators gain support.</p>

<div id="Chapter 4" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <h4>Finally, this is Chapter 4, which includes questions, as well as a few constructed responses.</h4>
  <h4>Part 1</h4>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Why do people follow Dictators?</b></li>
  <p>They promised great things and make you believe that they will do them.</p>
  <p>People follow dictators because they wouldn’t get punished if they revolt again the most powerful man. Also, by following a dictator, the dictator would support them, since they support the dictator.</p>
  <li><b>Would you follow A Dictator, and Why?</b></li>
  <p>I would not I would fight and try to overthrow and put us into a democracy. I would establish peace and harmony and make things good.</p>
  <p>I think that I would follow a dictator, because if I don’t, I could be severely punished, or people that I care about.</p>
  <li><b>What if they asked you to hurt someone else?</b></li>
  <p>I would hurt them instead and do whatever it takes to take them down.</p>
  <p>If someone else is harming someone I care about/love, I would harm them, possibly even kill them, depending on their goals. </p>
  </ol>
  <h4>Part 3</h4>
  <p>Propaganda is something we need to watch out for. As a society, humans are prone to propaganda. We like hearing things that sound like a good plan. We want others to to the planning because we're too lazy to do it ourselves. Dictators will usually come in a time of need. They prey upon the weak and if you have a weak society, they will prey on that. Propaganda is something we need to watch out for. In conclusion, propaganda is bad because it is taking advantage of people and their fear.</p></br>
  <p>Dear viewers,</p>
	You should never side with someone who promotes violence because they might threaten you, people you care about, or your family. First off, never join leaders who promote violence because they might threaten you. Most people support leaders just because they are afraid of having a punishment. Secondly, you should never follow someone who promotes violence because they might threaten someone you care about. By joining a leader that promotes violence, he might give you a task you will have to refuse, but instead of taking a no for an answer, he might threaten someone you care about; another reason not to join leaders who promote violence. Subsequently, you should never side with someone who promotes violence because they might threaten your family. A family is one of the most important things to a person, so instead of joining a leader that might threaten your family if you don’t do what they say, don't join them at all. In conclusion, you should never side with a leader who promotes violence because they might threaten you, people you care about, and/or your family.</p>
